# Vipul-Eth-Beginner
In this program which I have written using the IDE Remix for Solidity, which is a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain. This ccontract has 3 public variables that store data about the Token Name, Token Abbreviation and the total supply. I then create a public mapping variable called balances which is mapped from the address to the value. I then create two public functions called mint and burn, where mint is supposed to credit tokens to the provided address and the burn function is supposed to debit tokens from the address after confirming the presence of the amount of tokens using an if loop.
